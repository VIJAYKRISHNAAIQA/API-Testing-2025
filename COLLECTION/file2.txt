To push your local repo to a remote GitHub repo, follow these steps — assuming your local work is ready and the remote repo already exists (which seems to be the case from your command).

✅ Steps to Push Local Repo to Remote (Clean Setup)
Check if you're on the correct branch (usually main):

bash
Copy
Edit
git branch
If you're not on main, switch:

bash
Copy
Edit
git checkout main
Fetch the latest changes from the remote (important to avoid conflicts):

bash
Copy
Edit
git pull origin main
This ensures your local branch includes anything that was pushed to GitHub after you cloned or last pulled.

Add and commit your changes (if you haven’t already):

bash
Copy
Edit
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
Push your local changes to the remote repo:

bash
Copy
Edit
git push origin main
💥 If You Get the Error Again
You probably need to integrate remote changes first. Use:

bash
Copy
Edit
git pull origin main --rebase
# or
git pull origin main
Then push again:

bash
Copy
Edit
git push origin main
❗ If You Don’t Care About Remote Changes (Force Push)
If you're sure the local version is correct and you want to overwrite the remote repo (⚠️ be careful):

bash
Copy
Edit
git push --force origin main

Absolutely — in the daily life of a QA Automation Tester, git push and git pull are crucial parts of the workflow when working on automation scripts or collaborating with the dev team in a project.

Here's how these commands fit into a QA Automation Tester’s routine in projects:

🔽 git pull – Keeping Your Local Code Updated
When do testers use it?
At the start of the day or before any work, to ensure they have the latest codebase.

Before running test scripts, to make sure tests are executed against the latest application code or configurations.

When merging changes from other team members (e.g., developers updating page elements or API responses).

Example:
bash
Copy
Edit
git pull origin main
💡 Use it to fetch the latest feature updates, bug fixes, or updated test data files.

🔼 git push – Sharing Your Work
When do testers use it?
After writing or updating automation scripts (like Selenium, Cypress, etc.).

After fixing bugs in existing test cases.

When adding new test data files or configuration files.

Example:
bash
Copy
Edit
git push origin feature/test-login
💡 Push your changes so other QA members or CI/CD tools (like Jenkins) can access and run your latest scripts.

🌐 Real-Life QA Example Workflow
Start your day:

bash
Copy
Edit
git pull origin main
Work on a new test case (e.g., for a login feature).

Add your code to a new branch:

bash
Copy
Edit
git checkout -b feature/test-login
Write test cases and commit changes:

bash
Copy
Edit
git add .
git commit -m "Added test case for login functionality"
Push to remote:

bash
Copy
Edit
git push origin feature/test-login
✅ Benefits in a QA Automation Project:
Keeps test scripts and test data in sync with the rest of the team.

Ensures collaborative development, especially in Agile or DevOps environments.

Triggers automated CI/CD pipelines that run test suites after every push.
