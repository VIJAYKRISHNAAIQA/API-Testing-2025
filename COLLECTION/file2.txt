To push your local repo to a remote GitHub repo, follow these steps ‚Äî assuming your local work is ready and the remote repo already exists (which seems to be the case from your command).

‚úÖ Steps to Push Local Repo to Remote (Clean Setup)
Check if you're on the correct branch (usually main):

bash
Copy
Edit
git branch
If you're not on main, switch:

bash
Copy
Edit
git checkout main
Fetch the latest changes from the remote (important to avoid conflicts):

bash
Copy
Edit
git pull origin main
This ensures your local branch includes anything that was pushed to GitHub after you cloned or last pulled.

Add and commit your changes (if you haven‚Äôt already):

bash
Copy
Edit
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
Push your local changes to the remote repo:

bash
Copy
Edit
git push origin main
üí• If You Get the Error Again
You probably need to integrate remote changes first. Use:

bash
Copy
Edit
git pull origin main --rebase
# or
git pull origin main
Then push again:

bash
Copy
Edit
git push origin main
‚ùó If You Don‚Äôt Care About Remote Changes (Force Push)
If you're sure the local version is correct and you want to overwrite the remote repo (‚ö†Ô∏è be careful):

bash
Copy
Edit
git push --force origin main
