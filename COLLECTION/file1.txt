You're seeing this error because the remote branch (main on GitHub) has commits that your local branch does not. Git is refusing to let you push because it would overwrite remote history.

‚úÖ What to Do
You need to pull the latest changes from the remote before you can push.

üîß Fix it step-by-step:
1. Pull the remote changes and merge them:
bash
Copy
Edit
git pull origin main
If there are no merge conflicts, Git will merge them and you're done. Then push:

bash
Copy
Edit
git push origin main
2. If you want a cleaner history, use rebase instead:
bash
Copy
Edit
git pull --rebase origin main
This will replay your commits on top of the latest remote commits. Then push:

bash
Copy
Edit
git push origin main
‚ö†Ô∏è If You Are Sure You Want to Overwrite Remote
Use force push only if you're 100% sure your local version should overwrite everything on GitHub (e.g., it‚Äôs a solo project and remote changes aren‚Äôt important):

bash
Copy
Edit
git push --force origin main
