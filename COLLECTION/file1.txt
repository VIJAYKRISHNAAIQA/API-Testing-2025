You're seeing this error because the remote branch (main on GitHub) has commits that your local branch does not. Git is refusing to let you push because it would overwrite remote history.

‚úÖ What to Do
You need to pull the latest changes from the remote before you can push.

üîß Fix it step-by-step:
1. Pull the remote changes and merge them:
bash
Copy
Edit
git pull origin main
If there are no merge conflicts, Git will merge them and you're done. Then push:

bash
Copy
Edit
git push origin main
2. If you want a cleaner history, use rebase instead:
bash
Copy
Edit
git pull --rebase origin main
This will replay your commits on top of the latest remote commits. Then push:

bash
Copy
Edit
git push origin main
‚ö†Ô∏è If You Are Sure You Want to Overwrite Remote
Use force push only if you're 100% sure your local version should overwrite everything on GitHub (e.g., it‚Äôs a solo project and remote changes aren‚Äôt important):

bash
Copy
Edit
git push --force origin main
üìå Summary
Action	Command
Merge remote changes	git pull origin main
Rebase on remote	git pull --rebase origin main
Force push (overwrite)	git push --force origin main
=====================================================
In Git, push and pull are two essential commands used for sharing and retrieving code between your local repository and a remote repository (like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.). Here's a breakdown of what they do:

üîº git push
Purpose: Upload your local commits (changes) to a remote repository.

Syntax:
bash
Copy
Edit
git push <remote> <branch>
Example:
bash
Copy
Edit
git push origin main
origin: The default name of the remote repository.

main: The branch you're pushing to.

What it does:
Sends your local changes to the remote repo.

Other collaborators will see your changes once they pull.

üîΩ git pull
Purpose: Fetch and merge changes from a remote repository into your current local branch.

Syntax:
bash
Copy
Edit
git pull <remote> <branch>
Example:
bash
Copy
Edit
git pull origin main
What it does:
Downloads the latest changes from the remote branch.

Merges them into your current local branch.

Visual Summary:
sql
Copy
Edit
Local Repo  <-- git pull --  Remote Repo
           --> git push -->
Common Pitfalls:
If your local branch is behind the remote, git push may fail. You'll need to git pull first to sync.

Merge conflicts can occur during git pull if changes overlap.
